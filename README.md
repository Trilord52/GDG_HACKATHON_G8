## 📌 Project Objectives

**Main Goal:**  
Build a mobile app to improve campus safety by enabling:
- Real-time location tracking
- Incident reporting
- Emergency communication

### Core Features:
- ✅ Real-time location tracking with shareable tokens (`live_tracker.dart`)
- ✅ Interactive map with route sharing and incident markers (`safety_map.dart`)
- ✅ Anonymous incident reporting with optional media (photo/video)
- ✅ Trusted contact management for emergency location sharing (`homepage.dart`)
- ✅ SOS button for quick emergency alerts (`home.dart`)
- ✅ Nearby incident notifications based on proximity

---


🌟 Key Features
📍 Real-Time Location Tracking
Share live location with trusted contacts via a unique token.

View current location (latitude, longitude, and general area) in the Live Tracker tab.

🗺️ Interactive Safety Map
View your location on an OpenStreetMap interface.

Search destinations and get routes.

Report incidents anonymously with optional media.

Get alerts for nearby incidents within 0.5 km.

👥 Trusted Contacts Management
Add/manage trusted contacts who can access your live location in emergencies.

Accessible from the dashboard and map viewer sidebar.

🚨 SOS Emergency Button
Instantly trigger an emergency alert to notify trusted contacts.
